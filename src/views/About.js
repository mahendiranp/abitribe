                  <h2>GROUP TESTING: (GTO)</h2>
                  <p>The GTO testing extracts the dynamism of your personality when applied to the context of a group. Here, people often mistaken that a group is judged as a whole, but the assessment is purely individual and every task you perform has a positive or negative impact on your score. These tasks are designed to test how a person will function when put in a group, will he only take orders or will he just give orders or will he just speculate others. Every individual performs differently in these tasks and you can’t train yourself to act in a fixed manner. Your efforts will vary based on different situations.
                     <br/>
                     Group testing is divided into three major subparts:

                  <ol>
                     <li>
                        <strong> 	PGT (Progressive Group Tasks)</strong> <br/>
                        <p>••	The group is given around 30 minutes and a series of obstacles, required materials and other instructions and the task is to complete all the obstacles. Generally you have to take some material from one boundary to other boundary. <br/>
                           •	The approach here is to show the team-game and not to win individual battles. Remember a team’s strength is the strength of its weakest link, so assess all your moves keeping the group in mind. Do pay close attention to what the GTO tells about the task and then proceed.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>	GPE(Group Planning Exercise)</strong><br/>
                        <p> •	GPE is one of the most interesting tasks of the SSB, it is where all your planning and imagination with cumulative assessment of risks involved come into play. You are made to sit around a sand model and there is a problem in the scenario. <br/>
                           •	Your task is to solve the problem in the most practical manner analysing all the risks involved. This is a Group Discussion round, so every individual has to first pen down the plan on a paper and then discuss it with the group. The final output of the executable plan is what the whole group agrees with.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <strong> 	CT(Command  Task)</strong><br/>
                        <p> •	The command task is a confirmatory test of your ‘leadership’, since all the testing till now has been along with the group; here each individual is assessed by his ability to command a team. You are given a set of obstacles and the required materials; your task is to call some of your teammates for help. <br/>
                           •	In this task have to make a plan to clear all the obstacles and guide your teammates along. The assessor tests your ability to explain your plan and innovate if one plan fails. Also this is a test of how well you assess your teammates.
